 [![pipeline status](https://gitlab.pxeger.com/attempt-this-online/languages/badges/main/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.pxeger.com/attempt-this-online/languages/-/-/pipelines)

A collection of Docker images for running a large variety of programming languages, both practical and esoteric. These
images form the execution environments for running these languages on [Attempt This Online](https://ato.pxeger.com).
They are **not intended for general use**, and they may change drastically at any time.
